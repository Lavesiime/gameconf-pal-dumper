# gameconf-pal-tools
A set of tools for GameConfig palettes from Retro Engine V4 games, like Sonic 1 and Sonic 2 2013.

As the name implies, `gameconf-pal-dumper.py` will dump the palette from a GameConfig to an `.act` palette file, while `gameconf-pal-injector.py` will inject an `.act` palette file into a GameConfig. To see how to use them, run them from the command line without any arguments.
